# Function that logs the details of a Cloud event

This function logs the details of a Cloud event.

As you make your way through this tutorial, look out for this icon ![user input icon](./images/userinput.png).
Whenever you see it, it's time for you to perform an action.


## Prerequisites
Before you deploy this sample function, make sure you have run step A, B and C of the [Oracle Functions Quick Start Guide for Cloud Shell](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/infographics/oci_functions_cloudshell_quickview/functions_quickview_top/functions_quickview/index.html)
* A - Set up your tenancy
* B - Create application
* C - Set up your Cloud Shell dev environment


## List Applications 
Assuming your have successfully completed the prerequisites, you should see your 
application in the list of applications.
```
fn ls apps
```


## Create or Update your Dynamic Group
In order to use other OCI Services, your function must be part of a dynamic group. For information on how to create a dynamic group, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm#To).

When specifying the *Matching Rules*, we suggest matching all functions in a compartment with:
```
ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaxxxxx'}
```
Please check the [Accessing Other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Resources from Running Functions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsaccessingociresources.htm) for other *Matching Rules* options.


## Review and customize your function
Review the following files in the current folder:
* the code of the function, [LogEvents.cs](./LogEvents.cs)
* its dependencies, [LogEvents.csproj](./LogEvents.csproj)
* the function metadata, [func.yaml](./func.yaml)


## Deploy the function
In Cloud Shell, run the *fn deploy* command to build the function and its dependencies as a Docker image, 
push the image to OCIR, and deploy the function to Oracle Functions in your application.

```
fn -v deploy --app <app-name>
```


## Create the Cloud Event rule
Create a Cloud Event rule on the console navigating to Application Integration > Event Service. Click *Create Rule*.

![user input icon](./images/1-create_event_rule.png)

Assign a display name and a description, customize the Rule Conditions or leave them empty to match all events. In the *Actions* section, set the *Action type* as "Functions", select your *Function Compartment*, your *Function Application*, and your *Function ID*.

## Test
Go to the logs, you should see events from your compartment. You can create some resource such as an Object Storage bucket to generate an event.
For example:
```json
event type: com.oraclecloud.objectstorage.createbucket
compartment name: greg-verstraeten
Full Cloud event json data:
{
    "eventType": "com.oraclecloud.objectstorage.createbucket",
    "cloudEventsVersion": "0.1",
    "eventTypeVersion": "2.0",
